# BrainROISynth

This is a rudimental set of matlab scripts and fsl calls to synthesize brain images based on AALv3 regions of interests.

## Prerequisites

You need Matlab and FSL, most likely running on a Linux system (although it should also work on Mac). 

## Data preparation

1. Download the AALv3 atlas and extract each ROI as a separate nii.gz file
